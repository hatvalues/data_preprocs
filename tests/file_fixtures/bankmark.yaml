spiel: "\n    Data Set Information:\n    The data is related with direct marketing\
  \ campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based\
  \ on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required,\
  \ in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not\
  \ ('no') subscribed.\n\n    There are four datasets:\n    1) bank-additional-full.csv\
  \ with all examples (41188) and 20 inputs, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November\
  \ 2010), very close to the data analyzed in [Moro et al., 2014]\n    2) bank-additional.csv\
  \ with 10% of the examples (4119), randomly selected from 1), and 20 inputs.\n \
  \   3) bank-full.csv with all examples and 17 inputs, ordered by date (older version\
  \ of this dataset with less inputs).\n    4) bank.csv with 10% of the examples and\
  \ 17 inputs, randomly selected from 3 (older version of this dataset with less inputs).\n\
  \    The smallest datasets are provided to test more computationally demanding machine\
  \ learning algorithms (e.g., SVM).\n\n    The classification goal is to predict\
  \ if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).\n\n\n    Attribute\
  \ Information:\n\n    Input variables:\n    # bank client data:\n    1 - age (numeric)\n\
  \    2 - job : type of job (categorical: 'admin.','blue-collar','entrepreneur','housemaid','management','retired','self-employed','services','student','technician','unemployed','unknown')\n\
  \    3 - marital : marital status (categorical: 'divorced','married','single','unknown';\
  \ note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed)\n    4 - education (categorical: 'basic.4y','basic.6y','basic.9y','high.school','illiterate','professional.course','university.degree','unknown')\n\
  \    5 - default: has credit in default? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')\n \
  \   6 - housing: has housing loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')\n    7 -\
  \ loan: has personal loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')\n    # related with\
  \ the last contact of the current campaign:\n    8 - contact: contact communication\
  \ type (categorical: 'cellular','telephone')\n    9 - month: last contact month\
  \ of year (categorical: 'jan', 'feb', 'mar', ..., 'nov', 'dec')\n    10 - day_of_week:\
  \ last contact day of the week (categorical: 'mon','tue','wed','thu','fri')\n  \
  \  11 - duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this\
  \ attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no').\
  \ Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end\
  \ of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for\
  \ benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic\
  \ predictive model.\n    # other attributes:\n    12 - campaign: number of contacts\
  \ performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)\n\
  \    13 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted\
  \ from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)\n\
  \    14 - previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this\
  \ client (numeric)\n    15 - poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign\
  \ (categorical: 'failure','nonexistent','success')\n    # social and economic context\
  \ attributes\n    16 - emp.var.rate: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator\
  \ (numeric)\n    17 - cons.price.idx: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric)\n\
  \    18 - cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric)\n\
  \    19 - euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric)\n    20 -\
  \ nr.employed: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric)\n\n    Output\
  \ variable (desired target):\n    21 - y - has the client subscribed a term deposit?\
  \ (binary: 'yes','no')\n    "
