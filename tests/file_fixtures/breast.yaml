  \    Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA)\
  \ of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in\
  \ the image. A few of the images can be found at [Web Link]\n    Separating plane\
  \ described above was obtained using Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett,\
  \ \"Decision Tree Construction Via Linear Programming.\" Proceedings of the 4th\
  \ Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society, pp. 97-101, 1992],\
  \ a classification method which uses linear programming to construct a decision\
  \ tree. Relevant features were selected using an exhaustive search in the space\
  \ of 1-4 features and 1-3 separating planes.\n    The actual linear program used\
  \ to obtain the separating plane in the 3-dimensional space is that described in:\
  \ [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: \"Robust Linear Programming Discrimination\
  \ of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets\", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992,\
  \ 23-34].\n\n    This database is also available through the UW CS ftp server:\n\
