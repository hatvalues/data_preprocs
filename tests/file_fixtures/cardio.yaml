spiel: "\n    Data Set Information:\n    2126 fetal cardiotocograms (CTGs) were automatically\
  \ processed and the respective diagnostic features measured. The CTGs were also\
  \ classified by three expert obstetricians and a consensus classification label\
  \ assigned to each of them. Classification was both with respect to a morphologic\
  \ pattern (A, B, C. ...) and to a fetal state (N, S, P). Therefore the dataset can\
  \ be used either for 10-class or 3-class experiments.\n\n    Attribute Information:\n\
  \    LB - FHR baseline (beats per minute)\n    AC - # of accelerations per second\n\
  \    FM - # of fetal movements per second\n    UC - # of uterine contractions per\
  \ second\n    DL - # of light decelerations per second\n    DS - # of severe decelerations\
  \ per second\n    DP - # of prolongued decelerations per second\n    ASTV - percentage\
  \ of time with abnormal short term variability\n    MSTV - mean value of short term\
  \ variability\n    ALTV - percentage of time with abnormal long term variability\n\
  \    MLTV - mean value of long term variability\n    Width - width of FHR histogram\n\
  \    Min - minimum of FHR histogram\n    Max - Maximum of FHR histogram\n    Nmax\
  \ - # of histogram peaks\n    Nzeros - # of histogram zeros\n    Mode - histogram\
  \ mode\n    Mean - histogram mean\n    Median - histogram median\n    Variance -\
  \ histogram variance\n    Tendency - histogram tendency\n    CLASS - FHR pattern\
  \ class code (1 to 10) # alternative class\n    NSP - fetal state class code (N=normal;\
  \ S=suspect; P=pathologic)\n    "
