spiel: "A random 0.1% sample without replacement of the original rcdv dataset.\n\n\
  \    Data Set Information:\n    This is a description of the data on the file, DATA1978.\n\
  \    The description was prepared by Peter Schmidt, Department of Economics, Michigan\
  \ State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824.\n    The data were gathered as\
  \ part of a grant from the National Institute of Justice to Peter Schmidt and Ann\
  \ Witte, “Improving Predictions of Recidivism by Use of Individual Characteristics,”\
  \ 84-IJ-CX-0021.\n    A more complete description of the data, and of the uses to\
  \ which they were put, can be found in the final report for this grant.\n    Another\
  \ similar dataset, contained in a file DATA1980 on a separate diskette, is also\
  \ described in that report.\n\n    The North Carolina Department of Correction furnished\
  \ a data tape which was to contain information on all individuals released from\
  \ a North Carolina prison during the period from July 1, 1977 through June 30, 1978.\n\
  \    There were 9457 individual records on this tape. However, 130 records were\
  \ deleted because of obvious defects.\n    In almost all cases, the reason for deletion\
  \ is that the individual’s date of release was in fact not during the time period\
  \ which defined the data set.\n    This left a total of 9327 individual records,\
  \ and accordingly there are 9327 records on DATA1978.\n\n    The basic sample of\
  \ 9327 observations contained many observations for which one or more of the variables\
  \ used in our analyses were missing.\n    Specifically, 4709 observations were missing\
  \ information on one or more such variables, and these 4709 observations constitute\
  \ the “missing data” file.\n    The other 4618 observations which contained complete\
  \ information were randomly split into an “analysis file” of 1540 observations and\
  \ a “validation file” of 3078 observations.\n\n    DATA 1978 contains 9327 individual\
  \ records. Each individual record contains 28 columns of data, representing the\
  \ following 19 variables.\n\n    WHITE ALCHY JUNKY SUPER MARRIED FELON WORKREL PROPTY\
  \ PERSON\n    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11-12 13-14 15-16 17-19 20-22 23-24 25-27 28\n\
  \n    WHITE is a dummy (indicator) variable equal to zero if the individual is black,\
  \ and equal to one otherwise. Basically, WHITE equals one for whites and zero for\
  \ blacks. However, the North Carolina prison population also contains a small number\
  \ of Native Americans, Hispanics, Orientals, and individuals of “other” race. They\
  \ are treated as whites, by the above definition.\n    ALCHY is a dummy variable\
  \ equal to one if the individual’s record indicates a serious problem with alcohol,\
  \ and equal to zero otherwise. It is important to note that for individuals in the\
  \ missing data sample (FILE = 3), the value of ALCHY is recorded as zero, but is\
  \ meaningless.\n    JUNKY is a dummy variable equal to one if the individual’s record\
  \ indicates use of hard drugs, and equal to zero otherwise. It is important to note\
  \ that for individuals in the missing data sample (FILE = 3), the value of JUNKY\
  \ is recorded as zero, but is meaningless.\n    SUPER is a dummy variable equal\
  \ to one if the individual’s release from the sample sentence was supervised (e.g.,\
  \ parole), and equal to zero otherwise.\n    MARRIED is a dummy variable equal to\
  \ one if the individual was married at the time of release from the sample sentence,\
  \ and equal to zero otherwise.\n    FELON is a dummy variable equal to one if the\
  \ sample conviction was for a felony, and equal to zero if it was for a misdemeanor.\n\
  \    WORKREL is a dummy variable equal to one if the individual participated in\
  \ the North Carolina prisoner work release program during the sample sentence, and\
  \ equal to zero otherwise.\n    PROPTY is a dummy variable equal to one if the sample\
  \ conviction was for a crime against property, and equal to zero otherwise. A detailed\
  \ listing of the crime codes which define this variable (and PERSON below) can be\
  \ found in A. Witte, Work Release in North Carolina: An Evaluation of Its Post Release\
  \ Effects, Chapel Hill, North Carolina: Institute for Research in Social Science.\n\
  \    PERSON is a dummy variable equal to one if the sample conviction was for a\
  \ crime against a person, and equal to zero otherwise. (Incidentally, note that\
  \ PROPTY plus PERSON is not necessarily equal to one, because there is an additional\
  \ miscellaneous category of offenses which are neither offenses against property\
  \ nor offenses against a person.)\n    MALE is a dummy variable equal to one if\
  \ the individual is male, and equal to zero if the individual is female.\n    PRIORS\
  \ is the number of previous incarcerations, not including the sample sentence. The\
  \ value -9 indicates that this information is missing.\n    SCHOOL is the number\
  \ of years of formal schooling completed. The value zero indicates that this information\
  \ is missing.\n    RULE is the number of prison rule violations reported during\
  \ the sample sentence.\n    AGE is age (in months) at time of release.\n    TSERVD\
  \ is the time served (in months) for the sample sentence.\n    FOLLOW is the length\
  \ of the followup period, in months. (The followup period is the time from relase\
  \ until the North Carolina Department of Correction records were searched, in April,\
  \ 1984.)\n    RECID is a dummy variable equal to one if the individual returned\
  \ to a North Carolina prison during the followup period, and equal to zero otherwise.\n\
  \    TIME is the length of time from release from the sample sentence until return\
  \ to prison in North Carolina, for individuals for whom RECID equals one. TIME is\
  \ rounded to the nearest month. (In particular, note that TIME equals zero for individuals\
  \ who return to prison in North Carolina within the first half month after release.)\
  \ For individuals for whom RECID equals zero, the value of TIME is meaningless.\
  \ For such individuals, TIME is usually recorded as zero, but it is occasionally\
  \ recorded as the length of the followup period. We emphasize again that neither\
  \ value is meaningful, for those individuals for whom RECID equals zero.\n    FILE\
  \ is a variable indicating to which data sample the individual record belongs. The\
  \ value 1 indicates the analysis sample, 2 the validation sampel and 3 is missing\
  \ data sample.\n    "
