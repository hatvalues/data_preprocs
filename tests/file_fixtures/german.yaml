  \   Von-Melle-Park 5\n    2000 Hamburg 13\n\n    Data Set Information:\n    Two\
  \ datasets are provided. the original dataset, in the form provided by Prof. Hofmann,\
  \ contains categorical/symbolic attributes and is in the file \"german.data\".\n\
  \    For algorithms that need numerical attributes, Strathclyde University produced\
  \ the file \"german.data-numeric\". This file has been edited and several indicator\
  \ variables added to make it suitable for algorithms which cannot cope with categorical\
  \ variables. Several attributes that are ordered categorical (such as attribute\
  \ 17) have been coded as integer. This was the form used by StatLog.\n\n    This\
  \ dataset requires use of a cost matrix:\n    . 1 2\n    ------\n    1 0 1\n   \
  \ -----\n    2 5 0\n\n    (1 = Good, 2 = Bad)\n    The rows represent the actual\
  \ classification and the columns the predicted classification.\n    It is worse\
  \ to class a customer as good when they are bad (5), than it is to class a customer\
  \ as bad when they are good (1).\n    "
