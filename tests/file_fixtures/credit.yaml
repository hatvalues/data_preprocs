  \ All attribute names and values have been changed to meaningless symbols to protect\
  \ confidentiality of the data.\n\n    This dataset is interesting because there\
  \ is a good mix of attributes -- continuous, nominal with small numbers of values,\
  \ and nominal with larger numbers of values. There are also a few missing values.\n\
