spiel: "This dataset uses 'mh1' as the class column, removing the other two options\n\
  \n    From Kaggle. The three columns used for treatment are as follows and have\
  \ been duplicated with shorter keys to make pre-processing easier:\n    mh1 = 'Have\
  \ you ever sought treatment for a mental health issue from a mental health professional?'\n\
  \    mh2 = 'Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition by a medical\
  \ professional?'\n    mh3 = 'Do you currently have a mental health disorder?'\n\n\
  \    There is also corruption in the file, with the column 'Why or why not?' being\
  \ duplicated as 'Why or why not?.1', which is somewhat buggy to remove.\n\n    These\
  \ issues have been addressed in the pre-processing of the data.\n    "
