  \ extracted from the Messidor image set to predict whether an image contains signs\
  \ of diabetic retinopathy or not. All features represent either a detected lesion,\
  \ a descriptive feature of a anatomical part or an image-level descriptor. The underlying\
  \ method image analysis and feature extraction as well as our classification technique\
  \ is described in Balint Antal, Andras Hajdu: An ensemble-based system for automatic\
  \ screening of diabetic retinopathy, Knowledge-Based Systems 60 (April 2014), 20-27.\
  \ The image set (Messidor) is available at [Web Link].\n\n    Attribute Information:\n\
  \    0) The binary result of quality assessment. 0 = bad quality 1 = sufficient\
  \ quality.\n    1) The binary result of pre-screening, where 1 indicates severe\
  \ retinal abnormality and 0 its lack.\n    2-7) The results of MA detection. Each\
  \ feature value stand for the\n    number of MAs found at the confidence levels\
  \ alpha = 0.5, . . . , 1, respectively.\n    8-15) contain the same information\
  \ as 2-7) for exudates. However,\n    as exudates are represented by a set of points\
  \ rather than the number of\n    pixels constructing the lesions, these features\
  \ are normalized by dividing the\n    number of lesions with the diameter of the\
  \ ROI to compensate different image\n    sizes.\n    Note - 2-7 and 8-15 are not\
  \ equal in number. Not sure what to call the last two ex.\n    16) The euclidean\
  \ distance of the center of\n    the macula and the center of the optic disc to\
  \ provide important information\n    regarding the patientâ€™s condition. This feature\n\
  \    is also normalized with the diameter of the ROI.\n    17) The diameter of the\
  \ optic disc.\n    18) The binary result of the AM/FM-based classification.\n  \
  \  19) Class label. 1 = contains signs of DR (Accumulative label for the Messidor\
  \ classes 1, 2, 3), 0 = no signs of DR.\n    "
