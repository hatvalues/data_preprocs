spiel: "Data Description:\n    The target is a multinomial response variable.\n  \
  \  Nursery Database was derived from a hierarchical decision model\n    originally\
  \ developed to rank applications for nursery schools. It\n    was used during several\
  \ years in 1980's when there was excessive\n    enrollment to these schools in Ljubljana,\
  \ Slovenia, and the\n    rejected applications frequently needed an objective\n\
  \    explanation. The final decision depended on three subproblems:\n    occupation\
  \ of parents and child's nursery, family structure and\n    financial standing,\
  \ and social and health picture of the family.\n    The model was developed within\
  \ expert system shell for decision\n    making DEX (M. Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert\
  \ system for decision\n    making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.).\n    "
