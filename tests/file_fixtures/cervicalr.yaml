spiel: "The cervical cancer dataset contains indicators and risk factors for predicting\
  \ whether a woman will get cervical cancer. The features include demographic data\
  \ (such as age), lifestyle, and medical history. The data can be downloaded from\
  \ the UCI Machine Learning repository and is described by Fernandes, Cardoso, and\
  \ Fernandes (2017)15.\n    The subset of data features used in the book’s examples\
  \ are:\n        Age in years\n        Number of sexual partners\n        First sexual\
  \ intercourse (age in years)\n        Number of pregnancies\n        Smoking yes\
  \ or no\n        Smoking (in years)\n        Hormonal contraceptives yes or no\n\
  \        Hormonal contraceptives (in years)\n        Intrauterine device yes or\
  \ no (IUD)\n        Number of years with an intrauterine device (IUD)\n        Has\
  \ patient ever had a sexually transmitted disease (STD) yes or no\n        Number\
  \ of STD diagnoses\n        Time since first STD diagnosis\n        Time since last\
  \ STD diagnosis\n        The biopsy results “Healthy” or “Cancer”. Target outcome.\n\
  \    The biopsy serves as the gold standard for diagnosing cervical cancer.\n  \
  \  Missing values for each column were imputed by the mode (most frequent value).\n\
